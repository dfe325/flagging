    <p>
        The following predicted concentrations of Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) are
        based on modeled correlations between FIB and weather or water conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flagging is based on safety thresholds for boating. The weather and water
        data is sourced from the CESN weather station at Community Boating and the
        USGS Waltham river flow gauge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently the predictions are only based on
        one year of historical statistics. An ideal model would include 2-3 years of
        history. New models will be developed in future years as more data is
        collected.
