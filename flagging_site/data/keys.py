"""
This file handles their access credentials and tokens for various APIs required
to retrieve data for the website.

The file that contains the credentials is called "vault.zip", and is referenced
by a constant, `VAULT_FILE`. This file is accessed using a password stored in
the config called `VAULT_PASSWORD`.

Inside the "vault.zip" file, there is a file named "keys.yml." And this is the
file with all the credentials (plus a Flask secret key). It looks like this:

    flask:
      secret_key: "<key is here>"
    hobolink:
      password: "<password is here>"
      user: "crwa"
      token: "<token is here>"
